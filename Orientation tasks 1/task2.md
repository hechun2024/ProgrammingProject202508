## **2. Real-world operational system – Restaurant order and service system**

A restaurant’s **order and service system** is a good example of a real-world operational system with variability, complexity, and interconnectedness:

###  Variability
- Customers arrive at unpredictable times and in groups of different sizes.
- Some customers order a full three-course meal, while others only order a drink.
- Preparation times vary depending on the dish.

###  Complexity
- The kitchen must handle many different orders at the same time, with limited chefs and cooking equipment.
- Waiters must manage multiple tables, take orders, serve food, and handle payments.
- Delays in one part of the process (e.g., kitchen backlog) affect the entire dining experience.

###  Interconnectedness
- If the kitchen is overloaded, customers wait longer, which increases the pressure on waiters.
- If there are not enough tables or staff, the waiting line at the entrance grows longer.
- Improving one part (e.g., hiring more kitchen staff) has an effect on other parts (e.g., waiters need to serve food faster).
