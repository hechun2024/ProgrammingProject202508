###Task 1### 

A common everyday situation where simulation is very useful is restaurant operations.

For example, we can simulate how customers arrive at different times, how long they wait to be seated, how quickly food is prepared, and how servers handle multiple tables.

Why simulation is better than experimenting in reality: if a real restaurant changes its table layout, hires more or fewer waiters, or tests new kitchen processes during business hours, it may upset customers, reduce revenue, or even cause safety issues. Simulation allows managers to try out these changes virtually without disturbing actual service.

Sustainability aspects: the simulation can measure food waste, energy consumption in the kitchen, and staff working hours. By optimizing these factors in a simulation, the restaurant can reduce waste, save energy, and provide a better dining experience.
