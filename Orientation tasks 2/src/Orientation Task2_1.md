# Orientation Tasks 2 â€“ Writing Tasks

## Task 1 (W)

**a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?**

Because customers keep arriving in the system continuously. If an arrival event did not schedule the next arrival, 
then only the very first customer would ever arrive and the simulation would stop. To model a real call centre (or any queuing system),
every arrival must create the *next* arrival, so that the flow of customers continues as in reality.

**b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service (of a single service point)?**

When a service starts, we already know its expected duration. Therefore, a *service completion event* must be scheduled. 
This ensures that after the right amount of time the customer will leave the service point, the operator will become free again, 
and possibly the next customer in queue can begin service.
