# Orientation Tasks 2 – Writing Tasks


## Task 4 (W)

**Continue the three-phase simulation example until one client of type Y exits the system.**

From the hand simulation steps:

- At **time 10**, the first Y customer (Y1) arrives and enters the router queue.
- At **time 11**, Y1 is moved from the router to Operator 2’s queue. Operator 2 starts service, and a completion event for Y1 is scheduled at **time 18**.
- At **time 18**, the completion event occurs: Y1’s service is finished by Operator 2, and Y1 leaves the system.

Therefore, the first Y-type client exits the system at **clock = 18 minutes**.
